      "{'text': ' The play begins with three pages disputing over the black cloak usually worn by the actor who delivers the prologue. They draw lots for the cloak, and one of the losers, Anaides, starts telling the audience what happens in the play to come; the others try to suppress him, interrupting him and putting their hands over his mouth. Soon they are fighting over the cloak and criticizing the author and the spectators as well.\\nIn the play proper, the goddess Diana, also called Cynthia, has ordained a \"solemn revels\" in the valley of Gargaphie in Greece. The gods Cupid and Mercury appear, and they too start to argue. Mercury has awakened Echo, who weeps for Narcissus, and states that a drink from Narcissus\\'s spring causes the drinkers to \"Grow dotingly enamored of themselves.\" The courtiers and ladies assembled for the Cynthia\\'s revels all drink from the spring.\\nAsotus, a foolish spendthrift who longs to become a courtier and a master of fashion and manners, also drinks from the spring; emboldened by vanity and self-love, he challenges all comers to a competition of \"court compliment.\" The competition is held, in four phases, and the courtiers are beaten. Two symbolic masques are performed within the play for the assembled revelers. At their conclusion, Cynthia (representing Queen Elizabeth) has the dancers unmask and shows that vices have masqueraded as virtues. She sentences them to make reparation and to purify themselves by bathing in the spring at Mount Helicon.\\nThe figure of Actaeon in the play may represent Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, while Cynthia\\'s lady in waiting Arete may be Lucy, Countess of Bedford, one of Elizabeth\\'s ladies in waiting as well as Jonson\\'s patroness.\\nThe play is notably rich in music, as is typical for the theatre of the boys\\' companies, which originated as church choirs.', 'title': \"Cynthia's Revels\", 'tokens': ['The', 'play', 'begins', 'with', 'three', 'pages', 'disputing', 'over', 'the', 'black', 'cloak', 'usually', 'worn', 'by', 'the', 'actor', 'who', 'delivers', 'the', 'prologue', '.', 'They', 'draw', 'lots', 'for', 'the', 'cloak', ',', 'and', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'losers', ',', 'Anaides', ',', 'starts', 'telling', 'the', 'audience', 'what', 'happens', 'in', 'the', 'play', 'to', 'come', ';', 'the', 'others', 'try', 'to', 'suppress', 'him', ',', 'interrupting', 'him', 'and', 'putting', 'their', 'hands', 'over', 'his', 'mouth', '.', 'Soon', 'they', 'are', 'fighting', 'over', 'the', 'cloak', 'and', 'criticizing', 'the', 'author', 'and', 'the', 'spectators', 'as', 'well', '.', 'In', 'the', 'play', 'proper', ',', 'the', 'goddess', 'Diana', ',', 'also', 'called', 'Cynthia', ',', 'has', 'ordained', 'a', 'solemn', 'revels', 'in', 'the', 'valley', 'of', 'Gargaphie', 'in', 'Greece', '.', 'The', 'gods', 'Cupid', 'and', 'Mercury', 'appear', ',', 'and', 'they', 'too', 'start', 'to', 'argue', '.', 'Mercury', 'has', 'awakened', 'Echo', ',', 'who', 'weeps', 'for', 'Narcissus', ',', 'and', 'states', 'that', 'a', 'drink', 'from', 'Narcissus', 's', 'spring', 'causes', 'the', 'drinkers', 'to', 'Grow', 'dotingly', 'enamored', 'of', 'themselves', '.', 'The', 'courtiers', 'and', 'ladies', 'assembled', 'for', 'the', 'Cynthia', 's', 'revels', 'all', 'drink', 'from', 'the', 'spring', '.', 'Asotus', ',', 'a', 'foolish', 'spendthrift', 'who', 'longs', 'to', 'become', 'a', 'courtier', 'and', 'a', 'master', 'of', 'fashion', 'and', 'manners', ',', 'also', 'drinks', 'from', 'the', 'spring', ';', 'emboldened', 'by', 'vanity', 'and', 'self-love', ',', 'he', 'challenges', 'all', 'comers', 'to', 'a', 'competition', 'of', 'court', 'compliment', '.', 'The', 'competition', 'is', 'held', ',', 'in', 'four', 'phases', ',', 'and', 'the', 'courtiers', 'are', 'beaten', '.', 'Two', 'symbolic', 'masques', 'are', 'performed', 'within', 'the', 'play', 'for', 'the', 'assembled', 'revelers', '.', 'At', 'their', 'conclusion', ',', 'Cynthia', '(', 'representing', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', ')', 'has', 'the', 'dancers', 'unmask', 'and', 'shows', 'that', 'vices', 'have', 'masqueraded', 'as', 'virtues', '.', 'She', 'sentences', 'them', 'to', 'make', 'reparation', 'and', 'to', 'purify', 'themselves', 'by', 'bathing', 'in', 'the', 'spring', 'at', 'Mount', 'Helicon', '.', 'The', 'figure', 'of', 'Actaeon', 'in', 'the', 'play', 'may', 'represent', 'Robert', 'Devereux', ',', '2nd', 'Earl', 'of', 'Essex', ',', 'while', 'Cynthia', 's', 'lady', 'in', 'waiting', 'Arete', 'may', 'be', 'Lucy', ',', 'Countess', 'of', 'Bedford', ',', 'one', 'of', 'Elizabeth', 's', 'ladies', 'in', 'waiting', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'Jonson', 's', 'patroness', '.', 'The', 'play', 'is', 'notably', 'rich', 'in', 'music', ',', 'as', 'is', 'typical', 'for', 'the', 'theatre', 'of', 'the', 'boys', \"'\", 'companies', ',', 'which', 'originated', 'as', 'church', 'choirs', '.'], 'url': \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia's_Revels\"}\n"

      "\n",
      "THE greatest of English dramatists except Shakespeare, the first\n",
      "literary dictator and poet-laureate, a writer of verse, prose,\n",
      "satire, and criticism who most potently of all the men of his time\n",
      "affected the subsequent course of English letters: such was Ben\n",
      "Jonson, and as such his strong personality assumes an interest to\n",
      "us almost unparalleled, at least in his age.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ben Jonson came of the stock that was centuries after to give to\n",
      "the world Thomas Carlyle; for Jonson's grandfather was of\n",
      "Annandale, over the Solway, whence he migrated to England.\n",
      "Jonson's father lost his estate under Queen Mary, \"having been cast\n",
      "into prison and forfeited.\"  He entered the church, but died a\n",
      "month before his illustrious son was born, leaving his widow and\n",
      "child in poverty.  Jonson's birthplace was Westminster, and the\n",
      "time of his birth early in 1573.  He was thus nearly ten years\n",
      "Shakespeare's junior, and less well off, if a trifle better born.\n",
      "But Jonson did not profit even by this slight advantage.  His\n",
      "mother married beneath her, a wright or bricklayer, and Jonson was\n",
      "for a time apprenticed to the trade.  As a youth he attracted the\n",
      "attention of the famous antiquary, William Camden, then usher at\n",
      "Westminster School, and there the poet laid the solid foundations\n",
      "of his classical learning.  Jonson always held Camden in\n",
      "veneration, acknowledging that to him he owed,\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"All that I am in arts, all that I know;\"\n",
      "\n",
      "and dedicating his first dramatic success, \"Every Man in His\n",
      "Humour,\" to him.  It is doubtful whether Jonson ever went to either\n",
      "university, though Fuller says that he was \"statutably admitted\n",
      "into St. John's College, Cambridge.\"  He tells us that he took no\n",
      "degree, but was later \"Master of Arts in both the universities, by\n",
      "their favour, not his study.\"  When a mere youth Jonson enlisted as\n",
      "a soldier, trailing his pike in Flanders in the protracted wars of\n",
      "William the Silent against the Spanish.  Jonson was a large and\n",
      "raw-boned lad; he became by his own account in time exceedingly\n",
      "bulky.  In chat with his friend William Drummond of Hawthornden,\n",
      "Jonson told how \"in his service in the Low Countries he had, in the\n",
      "face of both the camps, killed an enemy, and taken opima spolia\n",
      "from him;\" and how \"since his coming to England, being appealed to\n",
      "the fields, he had killed his adversary which had hurt him in the\n",
      "arm and whose sword was ten inches longer than his.\"  Jonson's\n",
      "reach may have made up for the lack of his sword; certainly his\n",
      "prowess lost nothing in the telling.  Obviously Jonson was brave,\n",
      "combative, and not averse to talking of himself and his doings.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1592, Jonson returned from abroad penniless.  Soon after he\n",
      "married, almost as early and quite as imprudently as Shakespeare.\n",
      "He told Drummond curtly that \"his wife was a shrew, yet honest\";\n",
      "for some years he lived apart from her in the household of Lord\n",
      "Albany.  Yet two touching epitaphs among Jonson's \"Epigrams,\" \"On\n",
      "my first daughter,\" and \"On my first son,\" attest the warmth of the\n",
      "poet's family affections.  The daughter died in infancy, the son of\n",
      "the plague; another son grew up to manhood little credit to his\n",
      "father whom he survived.  We know nothing beyond this of Jonson's\n",
      "domestic life.\n",
      "\n",
      "How soon Jonson drifted into what we now call grandly \"the\n",
      "theatrical profession\" we do not know.  In 1593, Marlowe made his\n",
      "tragic exit from life, and Greene, Shakespeare's other rival on the\n",
      "popular stage, had preceded Marlowe in an equally miserable death\n",
      "the year before.  Shakespeare already had the running to himself.\n",
      "Jonson appears first in the employment of Philip Henslowe, the\n",
      "exploiter of several troupes of players, manager, and father-in-law\n",
      "of the famous actor, Edward Alleyn.  From entries in \"Henslowe's\n",
      "Diary,\" a species of theatrical account book which has been handed\n",
      "down to us, we know that Jonson was connected with the Admiral's\n",
      "men; for he borrowed 4 pounds of Henslowe, July 28, 1597, paying\n",
      "back 3s. 9d. on the same day on account of his \"share\" (in what is\n",
      "not altogether clear); while later, on December 3, of the same\n",
      "year, Henslowe advanced 20s. to him \"upon a book which he showed\n",
      "the plot unto the company which he promised to deliver unto the\n",
      "company at Christmas next.\"  In the next August Jonson was in\n",
      "collaboration with Chettle and Porter in a play called \"Hot Anger\n",
      "Soon Cold.\"  All this points to an association with Henslowe of\n",
      "some duration, as no mere tyro would be thus paid in advance upon\n",
      "mere promise.  From allusions in Dekker's play, \"Satiromastix,\" it\n",
      "appears that Jonson, like Shakespeare, began life as an actor, and\n",
      "that he \"ambled in a leather pitch by a play-wagon\" taking at one\n",
      "time the part of Hieronimo in Kyd's famous play, \"The Spanish\n",
      "Tragedy.\"  By the beginning of 1598, Jonson, though still in needy\n",
      "circumstances, had begun to receive recognition.  Francis Meres--\n",
      "well known for his \"Comparative Discourse of our English Poets with\n",
      "the Greek, Latin, and Italian Poets,\" printed in 1598, and for his\n",
      "mention therein of a dozen plays of Shakespeare by title--accords\n",
      "to Ben Jonson a place as one of \"our best in tragedy,\" a matter of\n",
      "some surprise, as no known tragedy of Jonson from so early a date\n",
      "has come down to us.  That Jonson was at work on tragedy, however,\n",
      "is proved by the entries in Henslowe of at least three tragedies,\n",
      "now lost, in which he had a hand.  These are \"Page of Plymouth,\"\n",
      "\"King Robert II. of Scotland,\" and \"Richard Crookback.\"  But all of\n",
      "these came later, on his return to Henslowe, and range from August\n",
      "1599 to June 1602.\n",
      "\n",
      "Returning to the autumn of 1598, an event now happened to sever for\n",
      "a time Jonson's relations with Henslowe.  In a letter to Alleyn,\n",
      "dated September 26 of that year, Henslowe writes: \"I have lost one\n",
      "of my company that hurteth me greatly; that is Gabriel [Spencer],\n",
      "for he is slain in Hogsden fields by the hands of Benjamin Jonson,\n",
      "bricklayer.\"  The last word is perhaps Henslowe's thrust at Jonson\n",
      "in his displeasure rather than a designation of his actual\n",
      "continuance at his trade up to this time.  It is fair to Jonson to\n",
      "remark however, that his adversary appears to have been a notorious\n",
      "fire-eater who had shortly before killed one Feeke in a similar\n",
      "squabble.  Duelling was a frequent occurrence of the time among\n",
      "gentlemen and the nobility; it was an impudent breach of the peace\n",
      "on the part of a player.  This duel is the one which Jonson\n",
      "described years after to Drummond, and for it Jonson was duly\n",
      "arraigned at Old Bailey, tried, and convicted.  He was sent to\n",
      "prison and such goods and chattels as he had \"were forfeited.\"  It\n",
      "is a thought to give one pause that, but for the ancient law\n",
      "permitting convicted felons to plead, as it was called, the benefit\n",
      "of clergy, Jonson might have been hanged for this deed.  The\n",
      "circumstance that the poet could read and write saved him; and he\n",
      "received only a brand of the letter \"T,\" for Tyburn, on his left\n",
      "thumb.  While in jail Jonson became a Roman Catholic; but he\n",
      "returned to the faith of the Church of England a dozen years later.\n",
      "\n",
      "On his release, in disgrace with Henslowe and his former\n",
      "associates, Jonson offered his services as a playwright to\n",
      "Henslowe's rivals, the Lord Chamberlain's company, in which\n",
      "Shakespeare was a prominent shareholder.  A tradition of long\n",
      "standing, though not susceptible of proof in a court of law,\n",
      "narrates that Jonson had submitted the manuscript of \"Every Man in\n",
      "His Humour\" to the Chamberlain's men and had received from the\n",
      "company a refusal; that Shakespeare called him back, read the play\n",
      "himself, and at once accepted it.  Whether this story is true or\n",
      "not, certain it is that \"Every Man in His Humour\" was accepted by\n",
      "Shakespeare's company and acted for the first time in 1598, with\n",
      "Shakespeare taking a part.  The evidence of this is contained in\n",

      "Jonson's earliest comedy, and we have just learned that he was\n",
      "already reputed one of \"our best in tragedy.\"  Indeed, one of\n",
      "Jonson's extant comedies, \"The Case is Altered,\" but one never\n",

      "combines, in fact, situations derived from the \"Captivi\" and the\n",
      "\"Aulularia\" of that dramatist).  But the pretty story of the\n",

      "classics, but in the ideals of romantic love which Shakespeare had\n",
      "already popularised on the stage.  Jonson never again produced so\n",

      "\"Every Man in His Humour,\" probably first acted late in the summer\n",
      "of 1598 and at the Curtain, is commonly regarded as an epoch-making\n",
      "play; and this view is not unjustified.  As to plot, it tells\n",
      "little more than how an intercepted letter enabled a father to\n",
      "follow his supposedly studious son to London, and there observe his\n",
      "life with the gallants of the time.  The real quality of this\n",
      "comedy is in its personages and in the theory upon which they are\n",
      "conceived.  Ben Jonson had theories about poetry and the drama, and\n",
      "he was neither chary in talking of them nor in experimenting with\n",
      "them in his plays.  This makes Jonson, like Dryden in his time, and\n",
      "Wordsworth much later, an author to reckon with; particularly when\n",
      "we remember that many of Jonson's notions came for a time\n",
      "definitely to prevail and to modify the whole trend of English\n",
      "poetry.  First of all Jonson was a classicist, that is, he believed\n",
      "in restraint and precedent in art in opposition to the prevalent\n",
      "ungoverned and irresponsible Renaissance spirit.  Jonson believed\n",
      "that there was a professional way of doing things which might be\n",
      "reached by a study of the best examples, and he found these\n",
      "examples for the most part among the ancients.  To confine our\n",
      "attention to the drama, Jonson objected to the amateurishness and\n",
      "haphazard nature of many contemporary plays, and set himself to do\n",
      "something different; and the first and most striking thing that he\n",
      "evolved was his conception and practice of the comedy of humours.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Jonson has been much misrepresented in this matter, let us quote\n",
      "his own words as to \"humour.\"  A humour, according to Jonson, was a\n",
      "bias of disposition, a warp, so to speak, in character by which\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some one peculiar quality\n",
      "Doth so possess a man, that it doth draw\n",
      "All his affects, his spirits, and his powers,\n",
      "In their confluctions, all to run one way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But continuing, Jonson is careful to add:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But that a rook by wearing a pied feather,\n",
      "The cable hat-band, or the three-piled ruff,\n",
      "A yard of shoe-tie, or the Switzers knot\n",
      "On his French garters, should affect a humour!\n",
      "O, it is more than most ridiculous.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jonson's comedy of humours, in a word, conceived of stage\n",
      "personages on the basis of a ruling trait or passion (a notable\n",
      "simplification of actual life be it observed in passing); and,\n",
      "placing these typified traits in juxtaposition in their conflict\n",
      "and contrast, struck the spark of comedy. Downright, as his name\n",
      "indicates, is \"a plain squire\"; Bobadill's humour is that of the\n",
      "braggart who is incidentally, and with delightfully comic effect, a\n",
      "coward; Brainworm's humour is the finding out of things to the end\n",
      "of fooling everybody: of course he is fooled in the end himself.\n",
      "But it was not Jonson's theories alone that made the success of\n",
      "\"Every Man in His Humour.\"  The play is admirably written and each\n",
      "character is vividly conceived, and with a firm touch based on\n",
      "observation of the men of the London of the day.  Jonson was\n",
      "neither in this, his first great comedy (nor in any other play that\n",
      "he wrote), a supine classicist, urging that English drama return to\n",
      "a slavish adherence to classical conditions.  He says as to the\n",
      "laws of the old comedy (meaning by \"laws,\" such matters as the\n",
      "unities of time and place and the use of chorus): \"I see not then,\n",
      "but we should enjoy the same licence, or free power to illustrate\n",
      "and heighten our invention as they [the ancients] did; and not be\n",
      "tied to those strict and regular forms which the niceness of a few,\n",
      "who are nothing but form, would thrust upon us.\"  \"Every Man in His\n",
      "Humour\" is written in prose, a novel practice which Jonson had of\n",
      "his predecessor in comedy, John Lyly.  Even the word \"humour\" seems\n",
      "to have been employed in the Jonsonian sense by Chapman before\n",
      "Jonson's use of it.  Indeed, the comedy of humours itself is only a\n",
      "heightened variety of the comedy of manners which represents life,\n",
      "viewed at a satirical angle, and is the oldest and most persistent\n",
      "species of comedy in the language.  None the less, Jonson's comedy\n",
      "merited its immediate success and marked out a definite course in\n",
      "which comedy long continued to run.  To mention only Shakespeare's\n",
      "Falstaff and his rout, Bardolph, Pistol, Dame Quickly, and the\n",
      "rest, whether in \"Henry IV.\" or in \"The Merry Wives of Windsor,\"\n",
      "all are conceived in the spirit of humours.  So are the captains,\n",
      "Welsh, Scotch, and Irish of \"Henry V.,\" and Malvolio especially\n",
      "later; though Shakespeare never employed the method of humours for\n",
      "an important personage.  It was not Jonson's fault that many of his\n",
      "successors did precisely the thing that he had reprobated, that is,\n",
      "degrade \"the humour\" into an oddity of speech, an eccentricity of\n",
      "manner, of dress, or cut of beard.  There was an anonymous play\n",
      "called \"Every Woman in Her Humour.\"  Chapman wrote \"A Humourous\n",
      "Day's Mirth,\" Day, \"Humour Out of Breath,\" Fletcher later, \"The\n",

      "plays that follow it, contains two kinds of attack, the critical or\n",
      "generally satiric, levelled at abuses and corruptions in the\n",
      "abstract; and the personal, in which specific application is made\n",
      "of all this in the lampooning of poets and others, Jonson's\n",
      "contemporaries.  The method of personal attack by actual caricature\n",
      "of a person on the stage is almost as old as the drama.\n",
      "Aristophanes so lampooned Euripides in \"The Acharnians\" and\n",
      "Socrates in \"The Clouds,\" to mention no other examples; and in\n",
      "English drama this kind of thing is alluded to again and again.\n",
      "What Jonson really did, was to raise the dramatic lampoon to an\n",
      "art, and make out of a casual burlesque and bit of mimicry a\n",
      "dramatic satire of literary pretensions and permanency.  With the\n",
      "arrogant attitude mentioned above and his uncommon eloquence in\n",
      "scorn, vituperation, and invective, it is no wonder that Jonson\n",
      "soon involved himself in literary and even personal quarrels with\n",
      "his fellow-authors.  The circumstances of the origin of this\n",
      "'poetomachia' are far from clear, and those who have written on the\n",
      "topic, except of late, have not helped to make them clearer.  The\n",
      "origin of the \"war\" has been referred to satirical references,\n",

      "(reasonably identified with Marston) with scurrility, cowardice,\n",
      "and plagiarism; though the dates of the epigrams cannot be\n",

      "prefer for Carlo a notorious character named Charles Chester, of\n",
      "whom gossipy and inaccurate Aubrey relates that he was \"a bold\n",

      "the court, sonneteer, and companion of men of fashion.  These men\n",
      "held recognised positions to which Jonson felt his talents better\n",
      "entitled him; they were hence to him his natural enemies.  It seems\n",

      "Daniel under the characters Fastidious Brisk and Hedon, Munday as\n",
      "Puntarvolo and Amorphus; but in these last we venture on quagmire\n",

      "way to London, in the masques at court, and in the pastoral drama.\n",
      "As to Jonson's personal ambitions with respect to these two men, it\n",
      "is notable that he became, not pageant-poet, but chronologer to the\n",
      "City of London; and that, on the accession of the new king, he came\n",
      "soon to triumph over Daniel as the accepted entertainer of royalty.\n",

      "Queen Elizabeth's Chapel, among them Nathaniel Field with whom\n",

      "finer conception of form, but even he was contented to take all his\n",
      "ancient history from North's translation of Plutarch and dramatise\n",
      "his subject without further inquiry. Jonson was a scholar and a\n",
      "classical antiquarian.  He reprobated this slipshod amateurishness,\n",
      "and wrote his \"Sejanus\" like a scholar, reading Tacitus, Suetonius,\n",
      "and other authorities, to be certain of his facts, his setting, and\n",
      "his atmosphere, and somewhat pedantically noting his authorities in\n",
      "the margin when he came to print.  \"Sejanus\" is a tragedy of\n",
      "genuine dramatic power in which is told with discriminating taste\n",
      "the story of the haughty favourite of Tiberius with his tragical\n",
      "overthrow.  Our drama presents no truer nor more painstaking\n",
      "representation of ancient Roman life than may be found in Jonson's\n",
      "\"Sejanus\" and \"Catiline his Conspiracy,\" which followed in 1611.  A\n",
      "passage in the address of the former play to the reader, in which\n",
      "Jonson refers to a collaboration in an earlier version, has led to\n",
      "the surmise that Shakespeare may have been that \"worthier pen.\"\n",
      "There is no evidence to determine the matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1605, we find Jonson in active collaboration with Chapman\n",
      "and Marston in the admirable comedy of London life entitled\n",
      "\"Eastward Hoe.\"  In the previous year, Marston had dedicated his\n",
      "\"Malcontent,\" in terms of fervid admiration, to Jonson; so that the\n",
      "wounds of the war of the theatres must have been long since healed.\n",
      "Between Jonson and Chapman there was the kinship of similar\n",
      "scholarly ideals.  The two continued friends throughout life.\n",
      "\"Eastward Hoe\" achieved the extraordinary popularity represented in\n",
      "a demand for three issues in one year.  But this was not due\n",
      "entirely to the merits of the play.  In its earliest version a\n",
      "passage which an irritable courtier conceived to be derogatory to\n",
      "his nation, the Scots, sent both Chapman and Jonson to jail; but\n",
      "the matter was soon patched up, for by this time Jonson had\n",
      "influence at court.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the accession of King James, Jonson began his long and\n",
      "successful career as a writer of masques.  He wrote more masques\n",
      "than all his competitors together, and they are of an extraordinary\n",
      "variety and poetic excellence.  Jonson did not invent the masque;\n",
      "for such premeditated devices to set and frame, so to speak, a\n",
      "court ball had been known and practised in varying degrees of\n",
      "elaboration long before his time.  But Jonson gave dramatic value\n",
      "to the masque, especially in his invention of the antimasque, a\n",
      "comedy or farcical element of relief, entrusted to professional\n",
      "players or dancers.  He enhanced, as well, the beauty and dignity\n",
      "of those portions of the masque in which noble lords and ladies\n",
      "took their parts to create, by their gorgeous costumes and artistic\n",
      "grouping and evolutions, a sumptuous show.  On the mechanical and\n",
      "scenic side Jonson had an inventive and ingenious partner in Inigo\n",
      "Jones, the royal architect, who more than any one man raised the\n",
      "standard of stage representation in the England of his day.  Jonson\n",
      "continued active in the service of the court in the writing of\n",
      "masques and other entertainments far into the reign of King\n",
      "Charles; but, towards the end, a quarrel with Jones embittered his\n",
      "life, and the two testy old men appear to have become not only a\n",
      "constant irritation to each other, but intolerable bores at court.\n",
      "In \"Hymenaei,\" \"The Masque of Queens,\" \"Love Freed from Ignorance,\"\n",
      "\"Lovers made Men,\" \"Pleasure Reconciled to Virtue,\" and many more\n",
      "will be found Jonson's aptitude, his taste, his poetry and\n",
      "inventiveness in these by-forms of the drama; while in \"The Masque\n",
      "of Christmas,\" and \"The Gipsies Metamorphosed\" especially, is\n",
      "discoverable that power of broad comedy which, at court as well as\n",
      "in the city, was not the least element of Jonson's contemporary\n",
      "popularity.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Jonson had by no means given up the popular stage when he\n",
      "turned to the amusement of King James.  In 1605 \"Volpone\" was\n",
      "produced, \"The Silent Woman\" in 1609, \"The Alchemist\" in the\n",
      "following year.  These comedies, with \"Bartholomew Fair,\" 1614,\n",
      "represent Jonson at his height, and for constructive cleverness,\n",
      "character successfully conceived in the manner of caricature, wit\n",
      "and brilliancy of dialogue, they stand alone in English drama.\n",
      "\"Volpone, or the Fox,\" is, in a sense, a transition play from the\n",
      "dramatic satires of the war of the theatres to the purer comedy\n",
      "represented in the plays named above.  Its subject is a struggle of\n",
      "wit applied to chicanery; for among its dramatis personae, from\n",
      "the villainous Fox himself, his rascally servant Mosca, Voltore\n",
      "(the vulture), Corbaccio and Corvino (the big and the little\n",
      "raven), to Sir Politic Would-be and the rest, there is scarcely a\n",
      "virtuous character in the play.  Question has been raised as to\n",
      "whether a story so forbidding can be considered a comedy, for,\n",
      "although the plot ends in the discomfiture and imprisonment of the\n",
      "most vicious, it involves no mortal catastrophe.  But Jonson was on\n",
      "sound historical ground, for \"Volpone\" is conceived far more\n",
      "logically on the lines of the ancients' theory of comedy than was\n",
      "ever the romantic drama of Shakespeare, however repulsive we may\n",
      "find a philosophy of life that facilely divides the world into the\n",
      "rogues and their dupes, and, identifying brains with roguery and\n",
      "innocence with folly, admires the former while inconsistently\n",
      "punishing them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Silent Woman\" is a gigantic farce of the most ingenious\n",
      "construction.  The whole comedy hinges on a huge joke, played by a\n",
      "heartless nephew on his misanthropic uncle, who is induced to take\n",
      "to himself a wife, young, fair, and warranted silent, but who, in\n",
      "the end, turns out neither silent nor a woman at all.  In \"The\n",
      "Alchemist,\" again, we have the utmost cleverness in construction,\n",
      "the whole fabric building climax on climax, witty, ingenious, and\n",
      "so plausibly presented that we forget its departures from the\n",
      "possibilities of life.  In \"The Alchemist\" Jonson represented, none\n",
      "the less to the life, certain sharpers of the metropolis, revelling\n",
      "in their shrewdness and rascality and in the variety of the\n",
      "stupidity and wickedness of their victims.  We may object to the\n",
      "fact that the only person in the play possessed of a scruple of\n",
      "honesty is discomfited, and that the greatest scoundrel of all is\n",
      "approved in the end and rewarded.  The comedy is so admirably\n",
      "written and contrived, the personages stand out with such lifelike\n",
      "distinctness in their several kinds, and the whole is animated with\n",
      "such verve and resourcefulness that \"The Alchemist\" is a new marvel\n",
      "every time it is read.  Lastly of this group comes the tremendous\n",
      "comedy, \"Bartholomew Fair,\" less clear cut, less definite, and less\n",
      "structurally worthy of praise than its three predecessors, but full\n",
      "of the keenest and cleverest of satire and inventive to a degree\n",
      "beyond any English comedy save some other of Jonson's own.  It is\n",
      "in \"Bartholomew Fair\" that we are presented to the immortal\n",
      "caricature of the Puritan, Zeal-in-the-Land Busy, and the\n",
      "Littlewits that group about him, and it is in this extraordinary\n",
      "comedy that the humour of Jonson, always open to this danger,\n",
      "loosens into the Rabelaisian mode that so delighted King James in\n",
      "\"The Gipsies Metamorphosed.\"  Another comedy of less merit is \"The\n",
      "Devil is an Ass,\" acted in 1616.  It was the failure of this play\n",
      "that caused Jonson to give over writing for the public stage for a\n",
      "period of nearly ten years.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Volpone\" was laid as to scene in Venice.  Whether because of the\n",
      "success of \"Eastward Hoe\" or for other reasons, the other three\n",
      "comedies declare in the words of the prologue to \"The Alchemist\":\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our scene is London, 'cause we would make known\n",
      "No country's mirth is better than our own.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed Jonson went further when he came to revise his plays for\n",
      "collected publication in his folio of 1616, he transferred the\n",
      "scene of \"Every Man in His Humour\" from Florence to London also,\n",
      "converting Signior Lorenzo di Pazzi to Old Kno'well, Prospero to\n",
      "Master Welborn, and Hesperida to Dame Kitely \"dwelling i' the Old\n",
      "Jewry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In his comedies of London life, despite his trend towards\n",
      "caricature, Jonson has shown himself a genuine realist, drawing\n",
      "from the life about him with an experience and insight rare in any\n",
      "generation.  A happy comparison has been suggested between Ben\n",
      "Jonson and Charles Dickens.  Both were men of the people, lowly\n",
      "born and hardly bred.  Each knew the London of his time as few men\n",
      "knew it; and each represented it intimately and in elaborate\n",
      "detail.  Both men were at heart moralists, seeking the truth by the\n",
      "exaggerated methods of humour and caricature; perverse, even\n",
      "wrong-headed at times, but possessed of a true pathos and largeness\n",
      "of heart, and when all has been said--though the Elizabethan ran\n",
      "to satire, the Victorian to sentimentality--leaving the world\n",
      "better for the art that they practised in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1616, the year of the death of Shakespeare, Jonson collected his\n",
      "plays, his poetry, and his masques for publication in a collective\n",
      "edition.  This was an unusual thing at the time and had been\n",
      "attempted by no dramatist before Jonson.  This volume published, in\n",
      "a carefully revised text, all the plays thus far mentioned,\n",
      "excepting \"The Case is Altered,\" which Jonson did not acknowledge,\n",
      "\"Bartholomew Fair,\" and \"The Devil is an Ass,\" which was written\n",
      "too late.  It included likewise a book of some hundred and thirty\n",
      "odd \"Epigrams,\" in which form of brief and pungent writing Jonson\n",
      "was an acknowledged master; \"The Forest,\" a smaller collection\n",
      "of lyric and occasional verse and some ten \"Masques\" and\n",
      "\"Entertainments.\"  In this same year Jonson was made poet laureate\n",
      "with a pension of one hundred marks a year.  This, with his fees\n",
      "and returns from several noblemen, and the small earnings of his\n",
      "plays must have formed the bulk of his income.  The poet appears to\n",
      "have done certain literary hack-work for others, as, for example,\n",
      "parts of the Punic Wars contributed to Raleigh's \"History of the\n",
      "World.\"  We know from a story, little to the credit of either, that\n",
      "Jonson accompanied Raleigh's son abroad in the capacity of a tutor.\n",
      "In 1618 Jonson was granted the reversion of the office of Master of\n",
      "the Revels, a post for which he was peculiarly fitted; but he did\n",
      "not live to enjoy its perquisites.  Jonson was honoured with\n",
      "degrees by both universities, though when and under what\n",
      "circumstances is not known.  It has been said that he narrowly\n",
      "escaped the honour of knighthood, which the satirists of the day\n",
      "averred King James was wont to lavish with an indiscriminate hand.\n",
      "Worse men were made knights in his day than worthy Ben Jonson.\n",
      "\n",
      "From 1616 to the close of the reign of King James, Jonson produced\n",
      "nothing for the stage.  But he \"prosecuted\" what he calls \"his\n",
      "wonted studies\" with such assiduity that he became in reality, as\n",
      "by report, one of the most learned men of his time.  Jonson's\n",
      "theory of authorship involved a wide acquaintance with books and\n",
      "\"an ability,\" as he put it, \"to convert the substance or riches of\n",
      "another poet to his own use.\"  Accordingly Jonson read not only the\n",
      "Greek and Latin classics down to the lesser writers, but he\n",
      "acquainted himself especially with the Latin writings of his\n",
      "learned contemporaries, their prose as well as their poetry, their\n",
      "antiquities and curious lore as well as their more solid learning.\n",
      "Though a poor man, Jonson was an indefatigable collector of books.\n",
      "He told Drummond that \"the Earl of Pembroke sent him 20 pounds every\n",
      "first day of the new year to buy new books.\"  Unhappily, in 1623,\n",
      "his library was destroyed by fire, an accident serio-comically\n",
      "described in his witty poem, \"An Execration upon Vulcan.\"  Yet even\n",
      "now a book turns up from time to time in which is inscribed, in\n",
      "fair large Italian lettering, the name, Ben Jonson.  With respect\n",
      "to Jonson's use of his material, Dryden said memorably of him:\n",
      "\"[He] was not only a professed imitator of Horace, but a learned\n",
      "plagiary of all the others; you track him everywhere in their\n",
      "snow....But he has done his robberies so openly that one sees he\n",
      "fears not to be taxed by any law.  He invades authors like a\n",
      "monarch, and what would be theft in other poets is only victory in\n",
      "him.\"  And yet it is but fair to say that Jonson prided himself,\n",
      "and justly, on his originality.  In \"Catiline,\" he not only uses\n",
      "Sallust's account of the conspiracy, but he models some of the\n",
      "speeches of Cicero on the Roman orator's actual words.  In\n",
      "\"Poetaster,\" he lifts a whole satire out of Horace and dramatises\n",
      "it effectively for his purposes.  The sophist Libanius suggests the\n",
      "situation of \"The Silent Woman\"; a Latin comedy of Giordano Bruno,\n",
      "\"Il Candelaio,\" the relation of the dupes and the sharpers in \"The\n",
      "Alchemist,\" the \"Mostellaria\" of Plautus, its admirable opening\n",
      "scene.  But Jonson commonly bettered his sources, and putting the\n",
      "stamp of his sovereignty on whatever bullion he borrowed made it\n",
      "thenceforward to all time current and his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lyric and especially the occasional poetry of Jonson has a\n",
      "peculiar merit.  His theory demanded design and the perfection of\n",
      "literary finish. He was furthest from the rhapsodist and the\n",
      "careless singer of an idle day; and he believed that Apollo could\n",
      "only be worthily served in singing robes and laurel crowned.  And\n",
      "yet many of Jonson's lyrics will live as long as the language.  Who\n",
      "does not know \"Queen and huntress, chaste and fair.\"  \"Drink to me\n",
      "only with thine eyes,\" or \"Still to be neat, still to be dressed\"?\n",
      "Beautiful in form, deft and graceful in expression, with not a word\n",
      "too much or one that bears not its part in the total effect, there\n",
      "is yet about the lyrics of Jonson a certain stiffness and\n",
      "formality, a suspicion that they were not quite spontaneous\n",
      "and unbidden, but that they were carved, so to speak, with\n",
      "disproportionate labour by a potent man of letters whose habitual\n",
      "thought is on greater things.  It is for these reasons that Jonson\n",
      "is even better in the epigram and in occasional verse where\n",
      "rhetorical finish and pointed wit less interfere with the\n",
      "spontaneity and emotion which we usually associate with lyrical\n",
      "poetry.  There are no such epitaphs as Ben Jonson's, witness the\n",
      "charming ones on his own children, on Salathiel Pavy, the\n",
      "child-actor, and many more; and this even though the rigid law of\n",
      "mine and thine must now restore to William Browne of Tavistock the\n",
      "famous lines beginning: \"Underneath this sable hearse.\"  Jonson is\n",
      "unsurpassed, too, in the difficult poetry of compliment, seldom\n",
      "falling into fulsome praise and disproportionate similitude, yet\n",
      "showing again and again a generous appreciation of worth in others,\n",
      "a discriminating taste and a generous personal regard.  There was\n",
      "no man in England of his rank so well known and universally beloved\n",
      "as Ben Jonson.  The list of his friends, of those to whom he had\n",
      "written verses, and those who had written verses to him, includes\n",
      "the name of every man of prominence in the England of King James.\n",
      "And the tone of many of these productions discloses an affectionate\n",
      "familiarity that speaks for the amiable personality and sound worth\n",
      "of the laureate.  In 1619, growing unwieldy through inactivity,\n",
      "Jonson hit upon the heroic remedy of a journey afoot to Scotland.\n",
      "On his way thither and back he was hospitably received at the\n",
      "houses of many friends and by those to whom his friends had\n",
      "recommended him.  When he arrived in Edinburgh, the burgesses met\n",
      "to grant him the freedom of the city, and Drummond, foremost of\n",
      "Scottish poets, was proud to entertain him for weeks as his guest\n",
      "at Hawthornden.  Some of the noblest of Jonson's poems were\n",
      "inspired by friendship.  Such is the fine \"Ode to the memory of Sir\n",
      "Lucius Cary and Sir Henry Moryson,\" and that admirable piece of\n",
      "critical insight and filial affection, prefixed to the first\n",
      "Shakespeare folio, \"To the memory of my beloved master, William\n",
      "Shakespeare, and what he hath left us,\" to mention only these.  Nor\n",
      "can the earlier \"Epode,\" beginning \"Not to know vice at all,\" be\n",
      "matched in stately gravity and gnomic wisdom in its own wise and\n",
      "stately age.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if Jonson had deserted the stage after the publication of his\n",
      "folio and up to the end of the reign of King James, he was far from\n",
      "inactive; for year after year his inexhaustible inventiveness\n",
      "continued to contribute to the masquing and entertainment at court.\n",
      "In \"The Golden Age Restored,\" Pallas turns the Iron Age with\n",
      "its attendant evils into statues which sink out of sight; in\n",
      "\"Pleasure Reconciled to Virtue,\" Atlas figures represented as an\n",
      "old man, his shoulders covered with snow, and Comus, \"the god of\n",
      "cheer or the belly,\" is one of the characters, a circumstance which\n",
      "an imaginative boy of ten, named John Milton, was not to forget.\n",
      "\"Pan's Anniversary,\" late in the reign of James, proclaimed that\n",
      "Jonson had not yet forgotten how to write exquisite lyrics, and\n",
      "\"The Gipsies Metamorphosed\" displayed the old drollery and broad\n",
      "humorous stroke still unimpaired and unmatchable.  These, too, and\n",
      "the earlier years of Charles were the days of the Apollo Room of\n",
      "the Devil Tavern where Jonson presided, the absolute monarch of\n",
      "English literary Bohemia.  We hear of a room blazoned about with\n",
      "Jonson's own judicious \"Leges Convivales\" in letters of gold, of a\n",
      "company made up of the choicest spirits of the time, devotedly\n",
      "attached to their veteran dictator, his reminiscences, opinions,\n",
      "affections, and enmities.  And we hear, too, of valorous potations;\n",
      "but in the words of Herrick addressed to his master, Jonson, at the\n",
      "Devil Tavern, as at the Dog, the Triple Tun, and at the Mermaid,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We such clusters had\n",

      "\n",
      "But the patronage of the court failed in the days of King Charles,\n",
      "though Jonson was not without royal favours; and the old poet\n",
      "returned to the stage, producing, between 1625 and 1633, \"The\n",

      "of a Tub,\" the last doubtless revised from a much earlier comedy.\n",
      "None of these plays met with any marked success, although the\n",
      "scathing generalisation of Dryden that designated them \"Jonson's\n",
      "dotages\" is unfair to their genuine merits.  Thus the idea of an\n",
      "office for the gathering, proper dressing, and promulgation of news\n",
      "(wild flight of the fancy in its time) was an excellent subject for\n",
      "satire on the existing absurdities among newsmongers; although\n",
      "as much can hardly be said for \"The Magnetic Lady,\" who, in her\n",
      "bounty, draws to her personages of differing humours to reconcile\n",
      "them in the end according to the alternative title, or \"Humours\n",

      "caricature and the hard lines of allegory; the moralist is more\n",
      "than ever present, the satire degenerates into personal lampoon,\n",
      "especially of his sometime friend, Inigo Jones, who appears\n",
      "unworthily to have used his influence at court against the\n",
      "broken-down old poet.  And now disease claimed Jonson, and he was\n",
      "bedridden for months.  He had succeeded Middleton in 1628 as\n",
      "Chronologer to the City of London, but lost the post for not\n",
      "fulfilling its duties.  King Charles befriended him, and even\n",
      "commissioned him to write still for the entertainment of the court;\n",
      "and he was not without the sustaining hand of noble patrons and\n",

      "Jonson died, August 6, 1637, and a second folio of his works, which\n",
      "he had been some time gathering, was printed in 1640, bearing in\n",
      "its various parts dates ranging from 1630 to 1642.  It included all\n",
